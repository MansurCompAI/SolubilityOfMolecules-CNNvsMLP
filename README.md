## Abstract
One of the important pyhsicochemical  feutere of molecules is solubility. Nowadays, in the chemical industry this phenomena is widely used. However, due to lack of consistent and reliable data in the literatures, it is better to find an alternative way to get accurate data using machine learning techniques. In this study we aimed to train two different architectures namely MLP and CNN to classify the solubuilty depending on their chemical structures.
